SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
AT 5:00 AM, THE CENTER OF CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE MATTHEW WAS LOCATED
ABOUT 45 MILES EAST OF MELBOURNE AND ABOUT 45 MILES OF SOUTHEAST OF
CAPE CANAVERAL. MATTHEW HAS TURNED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT AND IS NOW
MOVING TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHWEST AT 14 MPH, ROUGHLY PARALLEL TO THE
FLORIDA EAST COAST.
SUSTAINED TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS WITH GUSTS TO HURRICANE FORCE ARE
CURRENTLY BEING REPORTED ALONG THE SPACE AND TREASURE COASTS FROM
AROUND FORT PIERCE INTO SOUTHEASTERN VOLUSIA COUNTY, AND ARE
APPROACHING THE GREATER DAYTONA BEACH AREA.
RECENT PEAK WIND GUSTS INCLUDE 85 MPH AT THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER,
74 MPH AT VERO BEACH, AND 70 MPH AT MELBOURNE. AN UNOFFICIAL REPORT OF
A SUSTAINED WIND OF 69 MPH WITH A GUST TO 88 MPH WAS RECENTLY RECEIVED
FROM SATELLITE BEACH.
MATTHEW WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ROUGHLY PARALLEL TO THE FLORIDA EAST
COAST THROUGH MID MORNING, WITH ITS OUTER EYEWALL AND ASSOCIATED
DESTRUCTIVE WINDS PASSING VERY CLOSE TO CAPE CANAVERAL. CONDITIONS
WILL DETERIORATE FURTHER ACROSS NORTHERN BREVARD AND VOLUSIA COUNTIES,
WITH FREQUENT WIND WIND GUSTS OF 60 TO 80 MPH, AND POTENTIALLY EXCEEDING
100 MPH OUT ON THE CAPE.
FREQUENT SQUALLS WITH GUSTS APPROACHING HURRICANE FORCE WILL CONTINUE
TO BE FELT FROM SOUTHERN BREVARD COUNTY SOUTHWARD ACROSS INDIAN RIVER,
AND SAINT LUCIE COUNTIES. SHOWERS AND OCCASIONAL SQUALLS WELL ABOVE
MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM FORCE WILL BE FELT ACROSS OKEECHOBEE, OSCEOLA,
ORANGE, SEMINOLE, AND LAKE COUNTIES.
REMAIN IN YOUR SAFE SHELTER! ALTHOUGH THE LATEST NATIONAL HURRICANE
TRACK CONTINUES TO KEEP THE CENTER OF MATTHEW OFFSHORE BREVARD AND
VOLUSIA COUNTIES, THE WESTERN POTION OF THE OUTER EYEWALL WILL PASS
VERY CLOSE TO THE EASTERN TIP OF CAPE CANAVERAL, AND COULD BRING
A RAPID ONSET OF VERY DESTRUCTIVE WINDS WELL ABOVE HURRICANE FORCE!
RESIDENTS AND VISITORS TO EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED
TO MONITOR THE LATEST PRODUCTS ISSUED BY YOUR LOCAL NATIONAL WEATHER
SERVICE OFFICE.
POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------
* WIND:
POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM THE MAIN WIND EVENT ARE NOW UNFOLDING ACROSS
EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA. REMAIN WELL SHELTERED FROM LIFE-THREATENING
WIND HAVING POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING IMPACTS OVER COASTAL BREVARD
AND VOLUSIA COUNTIES. IF REALIZED, THESE IMPACTS INCLUDE:
- STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO STURDY BUILDINGS, SOME WITH COMPLETE ROOF
AND WALL FAILURES. COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF MOBILE HOMES. DAMAGE
GREATLY ACCENTUATED BY LARGE AIRBORNE PROJECTILES. LOCATIONS
MAY BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS.
- NUMEROUS LARGE TREES SNAPPED OR UPROOTED ALONG WITH FENCES AND
ROADWAY SIGNS BLOWN OVER.
- MANY ROADS IMPASSABLE FROM LARGE DEBRIS, AND MORE WITHIN URBAN
OR HEAVILY WOODED PLACES. MANY BRIDGES, CAUSEWAYS, AND ACCESS
ROUTES IMPASSABLE.
- WIDESPREAD POWER AND COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES.
* SURGE:
POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM THE MAIN SURGE EVENT CONTINUE TO UNFOLD ACROSS
EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA. REMAIN WELL AWAY FROM LIFE-THREATENING
SURGE HAVING POSSIBLE EXTENSIVE IMPACTS. IF REALIZED, THESE IMPACTS INCLUDE:
- LARGE AREAS OF DEEP INUNDATION WITH STORM SURGE FLOODING
ACCENTUATED BY BATTERING WAVES. STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS,
WITH SEVERAL WASHING AWAY. DAMAGE COMPOUNDED BY FLOATING
DEBRIS. LOCATIONS MAY BE UNINHABITABLE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD.
- LARGE SECTIONS OF NEAR-SHORE ESCAPE ROUTES AND SECONDARY ROADS
MAY BE WASHED OUT OR SEVERELY FLOODED. FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEMS
AND BARRIERS MAY BECOME STRESSED.
- SEVERE BEACH EROSION WITH SIGNIFICANT DUNE LOSS.
- MAJOR DAMAGE TO MARINAS, DOCKS, BOARDWALKS, PIERS, AND OTHER
COASTAL STRUCTURES. MANY SMALL CRAFT BROKEN AWAY FROM MOORINGS,
ESPECIALLY IN UNPROTECTED ANCHORAGES WITH SOME LIFTED ONSHORE
AND STRANDED.
* FLOODING RAIN:
POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM THE FLOODING RAIN ARE STILL UNFOLDING ACROSS
EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA. REMAIN WELL GUARDED AGAINST LIFE-THREATENING
FLOOD WATERS HAVING POSSIBLE EXTENSIVE IMPACTS. IF REALIZED, THESE
IMPACTS INCLUDE:
- MAJOR RAINFALL FLOODING MAY PROMPT MANY EVACUATIONS AND RESCUES.
- RIVERS AND TRIBUTARIES MAY RAPIDLY OVERFLOW THEIR BANKS IN
MULTIPLE PLACES. SMALL STREAMS, CREEKS, CANALS, AND DITCHES MAY
BECOME DANGEROUS RIVERS. FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEMS AND BARRIERS MAY
BECOME STRESSED.
- FLOOD WATERS CAN ENTER MANY STRUCTURES WITHIN MULTIPLE
COMMUNITIES, SOME STRUCTURES BECOMING UNINHABITABLE OR WASHED
AWAY. MANY PLACES WHERE FLOOD WATERS MAY COVER ESCAPE ROUTES.
STREETS AND PARKING LOTS BECOME RIVERS OF MOVING WATER WITH
UNDERPASSES SUBMERGED. DRIVING CONDITIONS BECOME DANGEROUS.
MANY ROAD AND BRIDGE CLOSURES WITH SOME WEAKENED OR WASHED OUT.
* TORNADOES:
POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM TORNADOES ARE STILL UNFOLDING ACROSS PORTIONS
OF EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA NEAR THE TRACK OF HURRICANE MATTHEW. REMAIN
WELL BRACED AGAINST A TORNADO EVENT HAVING POSSIBLE LIMITED IMPACTS.
IF REALIZED, THESE IMPACTS INCLUDE:
- A FEW PLACES MAY EXPERIENCE TORNADO DAMAGE, ALONG WITH POWER
AND COMMUNICATIONS DISRUPTIONS.
- LOCATIONS COULD REALIZE ROOFS PEELED OFF BUILDINGS, CHIMNEYS
TOPPLED, MOBILE HOMES PUSHED OFF FOUNDATIONS OR OVERTURNED,
LARGE TREE TOPS AND BRANCHES SNAPPED OFF, SHALLOW-ROOTED TREES
KNOCKED OVER, MOVING VEHICLES BLOWN OFF ROADS, AND SMALL BOATS
PULLED FROM MOORINGS.
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------
NOW IS THE TIME TO REMAIN SAFELY SHELTERED FROM THE STORM. STAY
INSIDE AND AWAY FROM WINDOWS. LISTEN FOR UPDATES AND BE READY IN CASE
YOU LOSE ELECTRICAL POWER. LOCATE YOUR BATTERY POWERED RADIO AND
FLASHLIGHT FROM YOUR EMERGENCY SUPPLIES KIT. KEEP THESE ITEMS CLOSE.
DO NOT BE A THRILL SEEKER OR RISK YOUR LIFE FOR SENSELESS PHOTOS OR
VIDEOS. BE WISE AND AVOID BECOMING ANOTHER STATISTIC.
DO NOT RETURN TO EVACUATED AREAS UNTIL HAZARDOUS WINDS DIMINISH AND
FLOOD WATERS ABATE.
